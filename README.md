# DST4L2016
This is the GitHub repo for the DST4L 2016 event at DTU Library, Copenhagen, 7.-9. December: http://dst4l.info

ABOUT

Librarians have always been great at information management and organization. Librarians are also outstanding communicators 
and have been trained in transforming user information needs into strategies and resources for investigation and learning. 
These are core skills in data science and there is a need to focus on the role of librarians in data science in the Danish Research 
and Academic Library sector / DFFU-sector. The essential task of the data science professional is to transform raw, messy data into 
actionable knowledge that can be used by decision makers. Data Science Training for Librarians (DST4L) is a three day symposium that 
addresses the challenges of data science head on. DST4L is a hands-on introduction in ways to collect, clean, analyze, visualize and 
importantly share data. International teachers and speakers are present to put the practical and political application of data science 
into context and lead an open discussion into why data science is important for the evolving role of librarians.

BACKGROUND

Data Scientist Training for Librarians (DST4L) is an experimental course, started at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics 
John G. Wolbach Library (http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/lib/) and the Harvard Library (http://library.harvard.edu/) to train librarians to 
respond to the growing data needs of their communities. 
Data science techniques are becoming increasingly important to all fields of scholarship. In this hands-on course, librarians learn the 
latest tools for extracting, wrangling, storing, analyzing, and visualizing data. By experiencing the research data lifecycle themselves, 
librarians develop the data savvy skills that can help transform the services they offer. Read more about the original ideas here: 
(http://www.aspbooks.org/publications/492/031.pdf).

Thanks to the great souls and engaged librarians at the: 
DTU Library (http://www.bibliotek.dtu.dk/), 
The Royal Library in Copenhagen (http://www.kb.dk/en/index.html), 
The Royal School of Library and Information Science (http://iva.ku.dk/english/) 
and fundings from our contributors, DST4L is coming to Copenhagen, again. 

If you did not got to the the workshop, material will be made available via the DST4L website after the event is over. 
The workshop will be live streamed and recorded for people not attending the 3 days.

Use cases by 2 data scientists
Henriette Roued-Cunliffe, Royal School of Library and Information Science
Pedro Parraguez Ruiz, DTU Management

Presentations by data scientists - with examples of how they work data in their research, dealing with several aspects of visualising, accessing and handling data
Henriette Roued-Cunliffe, from IVA will present “The importance of open heritage data”.
She will present the current discussion on open heritage data in relation to GLAM institutions. This includes 5 questions that can be used to analyze the extent of open heritage data and what it looks like for galleries, libraries, archives and museums.
Pedro Parraguez Ruiz, from DTU Management will present “Visualisation of networks and co-authorship”
He will present his results and talk about how he used Tableau to visualise the findings

12.00-13.00
Lunch

13.00-17.00
Grappling with data
James Baker, School of History, Art History and Philosophy at the University of Sussex
Thomas Padilla, University of California, Santa Barbara

In this session Thomas and James will introduce you to two different approaches to grappling with library data.
First, we will use the UNIX command line to count and mine tabular data. Second, we will use OpenRefine to batch edit and normalise tabular data.
We will conclude by introducing you to a range of common challenges that come up when working with digital data and that can be solved buy building on the command line skills you have already learned. The aim of the session is to get you from having some data and having no idea what you can do with it, to having some data and having an idea of where to start.

17.30-22.00

Introduction to Tableau - Hands on Workshop
Stavris Solo , The Royal School of Library and Information Science

A hands-on workshop on how to use a powerful and intuitive visualization tool that allows to create a variety of visualizations. in this introductory session a detailed description of Tableau interface and terminology will be presented. Furthermore, different examples of filtering, grouping, sorting and hierarchizing the data in order to create basic and advanced charts will be shown.
Moreover, the workshop will also explore the basics of map visualizations and active dashboards that can be used later on for data analysis.

16.00-17.00
Libraries: Information Intermediaries
Steven Adler, Chief Data Scientist, IBM

Libraries are not just book archives. They are information intermediaries - places where people look up digital designs for 3D printing, combine Open Data sources to perform cognitive analytics, use video to bring the world to remote audiences, and work with automated manufacturing to reduce carbon emissions through local production. Data and Information are at the heart of the 21st Century Library and we’ll explore what that means in this presentation.
Steven Adler will give this final informal keynote while workshop attendees have a glass of wine or a beer

17.00-00.00
The End

Thanks for coming and enjoy your trip back home. We will share the outcome of the workshop with you as soon as possible.
